# 2017_state_elections
This is a desktop-sized version of a data interactive I'd created earlier for India's Wionews.com website. It's on the state elections in India taking place in early 2017. 

[Shapefiles](https://github.com/datameet/maps/tree/master/assembly-constituencies) and [data](https://github.com/datameet/india-election-data/blob/master/assembly-elections/assembly.csv) from Datameet and the Election Commission of India, any errors in analysis my own.
